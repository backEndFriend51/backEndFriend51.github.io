# About Me

My name is Rainer Stoehr, I was born in Munich 1983 on the 17th of May. 
However I m physically disabled since I was 6 years old, I have managed to 
be an optimist. I always try to keep my mind open for new things. Today I live 
at the east End of Munich in a home care community where I do some online jobs for the management.
